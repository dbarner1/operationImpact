A project started to give one the instructions and enablement to find and take 15 min actions for social/racial/or other change.  Uses intermediate Javascript logic, and while 94% HTML, is mostly duplicate code (which will be refactored in the future :).  Currently on hold and will be finished after learning firebase.
